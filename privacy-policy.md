**BlueSky Edit Privacy Policy**
1. **Data Collection:** "BlueSky Edit" does not collect, store, or transmit any personably identifiable information to external servers.
2. **Authentication:** Your BlueSky credentials (Handle and App Password) are stored locally on your device via Chrome’s secure storage API. They are used solely to authenticate your requests to the BlueSky API.
3. **Usage:** The extension only interacts with the BlueSky (`bsky.app`) website to inject its user interface and the BlueSky API (`bsky.social`) to perform post-editing actions on your behalf.
4. **Transparency:** No user data is ever sold or shared with third parties.
